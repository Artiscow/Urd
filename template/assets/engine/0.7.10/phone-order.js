/**
 * The order of a section's blocks on the phone, in the row grid (ADR-0019): pure, node-tested (tests/phone-order.test.mjs).
 * The section's rule (`phoneOrder`) reads its blocks top first, by their top on the desktop (or the key `mobileOrder` a preset gives them), or column by column where blocks stand beside each other on the desktop, the left or the right column first.
 * A block's exception (`phonePlace`) puts it directly before or after another block, wherever the rule puts that one.
 * A stack (`phoneStacks`) holds blocks that read as one, standing where the first of them in the rule's order stands, its first block's exception moving it whole; a custom order (`phoneList`) holds the order as listed, a block missing from it joining where the rule and the exceptions put it.
 * A block the owner took out of the rule's columns (`phoneLoose`) reads where the rule puts it, on its own: the column it stands in on the desktop no longer holds it.
 * The editor's moves (the list, the arrows) are reckoned in phone-moves.js.
